1: Practice data transformation
source file: Transformation.xlsx, which contains US population survey data

load "Table_1_1790_1860..." table from Transformation.xlsx
use "query editor" and "transform" tab do following jobs
remove row "District of Columbia" and "United States"
practice "move column", "transpose", "reverse" and "extract" function
remove states with "null" value, and get them back
replace "null" with 0
notice the data type of some value might be wrong: should be number but input as "text"
notice the first row as header or not
change to correct data type
unpivot all "year" column & add "year" column
close & apply query
load "Summary_by_state_district_.." from Transformation.xlsx
remove state with "null" value & "D.C."
notice the data type of some value might be wrong: should be number but input as "text"
notice the first row as header or not
notice in "relationships" panel, relationship is detected automatically

2: append & merge tables
source file: CustomColumn.xlsx, which contains population and growth rate for countries & countries in 7 continents

load each continent from "CustomColumn.xlsx"
use Query Editor do following jobs
remove column "flag", "status"
move "key" to begining
add custom column "Continent" for each table (using: ="Asian")
copy Affrica table and rename it AllCountries
append other contenent table to AllCountries table
note that "key" column becomes meaningless, remove it
add an index column starting "1"
google "Power Query "M" formula": Introduction to Power Query (informally known as "M") Formula Language
load population table and growth rate table, and cleaning those tables
notice in "ralationships" panel, relationship is detcted automaticaly
merge "population" and "growth rate" into one table

3: generate lookup table (relationship among tbales)
source file: CatlogRequests.xlsx, AllDates.xlsx, and ZipLatLong.xlsx

load "Requests" from CatlogRequest.xlsx, "Months" from AllDates.xlsx, ""zipcode" from "ZipLatLong.xlsx"
generate lookup table for zipcode and date
note the data type for zipcode should be "text"
note there is a row of "null" in "Months" table, remove it
use: data panel -> query editor -> manage relationships to detect and create relationships
note: cross filter directions: select "single" for lookup tables

4: create visualization
source file: the merged table from "append&merge tables" containing population&growth rate for each country and continent

use pop for each continent to create "data table", change font, add title, modify background and aspect
copy/paste "data table", and change it to "tree map", then paste again, and change to "bar chart"
use "new visual.." to add "data table" for "country" and "capital", and save this file
text visual: "table", "matrix", "card", and "multi-row-card", card will do "count" for text, and "sum" for number
add a "Slicer" to chart to filter the one to be displayed, hold "ctr" to select more than one
turn on/off the filter of Slicer using "Edt interaction"

source file: the pbix file from "generate lookup table (relationship among tbales)"
generate a map and add slicers to filter date and state
